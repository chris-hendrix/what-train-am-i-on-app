## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **MTA API Reliability**: Real-time data may be inconsistent or unavailable
   - *Mitigation*: Implement robust error handling and fallback responses
   
2. **Train Identification Accuracy**: Algorithm may struggle with complex scenarios
   - *Mitigation*: Extensive testing with real data, iterative algorithm improvement
   
3. **Geolocation Precision**: GPS accuracy varies significantly underground
   - *Mitigation*: Manual station selection fallback, location validation

4. **Docker Environment Complexity**: Multi-service development environment setup
   - *Mitigation*: Detailed documentation, containerized consistency

### Resource Constraints
1. **MTA API Rate Limits**: Production usage may hit API throttling
   - *Mitigation*: Implement caching, request queuing, monitor usage

2. **Express API Response Times**: Request latency may exceed targets under load
   - *Mitigation*: Performance monitoring, caching, load testing

### External Dependencies
1. **MTA Data Quality**: Accuracy depends on MTA's real-time feed quality
   - *Mitigation*: Cannot be fully controlled, implement data validation

2. **Browser Geolocation Permissions**: Users may deny location access
   - *Mitigation*: Clear permission requests, manual selection fallback
