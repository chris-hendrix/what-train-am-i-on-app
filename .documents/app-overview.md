# What Train Am I On? - App Overview

## Purpose
An MTA-focused mobile/web app that identifies the exact train a user is on and provides real-time arrival estimates for upcoming stops.

## Core Functionality
- Takes user location and train line number as input
- Identifies the specific train the user is currently on
- Shows estimated arrival times for next stops
- Initially supports MTA system only

## Documentation Structure
Documentation is organized by feature development date in the `features/` directory:
- Each feature folder follows the format: `YYYY-MM-DD_feature-name/`
- Every feature contains: `erd.md`, `prd.md`, and `ticket-plan.md`
- This overview provides context for future AI-assisted development

## Development Context
This app addresses the common transit rider problem of knowing which specific train they're on and when they'll reach their destination, particularly useful for express/local service differentiation and transfer planning.
